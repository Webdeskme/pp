Looking at my terminal, I open the radar's input feed and notice that one is going to an external analog output, and the other is reading as a virtual simulation port. I go into the config and see the virtual port is set as the default input. I switch the default to the anolog connection, and there it is: a ship that's crept up right behind our ship. It's so close to the engines that it's almost impossible to see.
