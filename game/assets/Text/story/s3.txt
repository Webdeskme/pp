I'm not too sure what's going on, so I just stand there frozen until the captain runs over to me. I ask what's going on. She answers me, "You tell me. It was something in your cyber security system that set off the alarm." Attempting to look like I know what I'm doing, I nod my head once and sit down at my terminal.
