I am a naval academy graduate, and I am commencing my commission on this vessel. I will be serving as the chief cyber security and warfare officer. I hope that my career will prove more promising than my predecessor’s. I should take a moment to get familiar with the ship. When I am ready, I will log in. My predecessor’s username is "admin" and the password is also "admin". I will need good luck, for my sake and the well-being of the ship!
