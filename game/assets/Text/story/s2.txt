The ship seems a lot smaller than I thought it would be. It doesnâ€™t look like the ship was built for comfort. The halls are narrow, and every wall looks like a stack of servers and monitors. All the machines project heat from vents, but at the same time the ventilation system is continually blowing cold air in my face. I find my seat, and just as I'm about to sit down an alarm starts going off, and a voice comes over the loudspeaker saying, "This is not a drill."
